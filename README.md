I wrote this many, many years ago as a learning exercise for an older love version. For the purpose of the learning about recent API changes, I have ported it to 11.2.

Features:
- the old-school snake experience
- multiple screen resolutions
- support for most keyboard layouts
- Highscore table
- many options (speed, multiple live mode, borderless mode)

Should run on Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX.

Keyboard required.

You can download the .love file and the Windows binary package [here.](https://github.com/Snaker1/LoveSnake/releases/latest)
